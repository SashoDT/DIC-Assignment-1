# Difficulties: 
Very difficult to understand how syntax of MRJob works, 
e.g.    how does DIC_runner call "make_runner()", "cat_output()", "parse_output()"; 
        what is a runner, how does MRJob even run, does it always call a function named steps()? 
Also difficulties to understand how to pass files with bash into python script 
Difficult to figure out how to compute A,B,C,D variables 

# Steps: 
First added the prep.py lines to our mapper; oriented by using assignment0 files 

Noticed that reading in stopwords file for every json-file line is inefficient 
-> Lead to v2, where stopwords file location can be passed in bash and read in only once 
also yields key pairs instead 

Next implement mapper and reducer to yield variables for ChiSquare computation: 
- Added 4 yield commands to mapper, to count different variables, 
every variable in ChiSquare can be computed from those numbers (big breakthrough). 
- Reducer is just the counter from assignment0 
- Next have to edit the runner script to give out the counters and compute 
ChiSquare statistic 

Now we need to order the terms and preserve the top 75 terms per category: 
- Sort terms by ChiSquare values and keep top 75 by using nlargest()
- Output just by using simple for-loop and print() 


# Run: 
Use sth like this to run in console (change "local" if ran in lbd and add paths): 
"python DIC_runner.py -r local --stopwords stopwords.txt reviews_devset.json > word_count.txt"

How to run on lbd cluster: 
- create zip-file out of "DIC_runner", "MapReduce_v2", "stopwords.txt" and maybe small json data file into folder Assignment1 (name here: Assignment1.zip)
- upload: scp Assignment1.zip e{studentID}@lbd.tuwien.ac.at:. 
- login: ssh e{studentID}@lbd.tuwien.ac.at 
- unzip: unzip Assignment1.zip
- change directory if zip contains folder Assignment1, else skip: cd Assignment1
- list files, if needed: ls - 1
- run: 
    python DIC_runner.py --stopwords stopwords.txt --hadoop-streaming-jar \
    /usr/lib/hadoop/tools/lib/hadoop-streaming-3.3.6.jar \
    -r hadoop hdfs:///user/dic25_shared/amazon-reviews/full/reviews_devset.json > output.txt


**Recap of the variable names for ChiSquare from the lecture:** 
- t ... term  
- c ... category  
- A ... number of documents in c which contain t  
- B ... number of documents not in c which contain t  
- C ... number of documents in c without t  
- D ... number of documents not in c without t  
- N ... total number of retrieved documents  (can be ommited for ranking)
